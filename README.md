# Mainframe sandbox playground

I will use this space as my learning playgroud for mainframe
programming languages mainly:

- Fortran
- Cobol

I recently fell for permacomputing and legacy operating systems and found
out, that these legacy systems are not so legacy. I see a potential of learning
these. I will also try to stay at the CLI as long as possible.

## Tech stuff

- Operating system: Ubuntu 22.04 (WSL 2)
- Shell: ZSH
- IDE: Vim

## Goal

The goal of this endeavour is be more aware of the mainframe ecosystem.
Possibly to learn well to be capable of performing reasonable operations.
